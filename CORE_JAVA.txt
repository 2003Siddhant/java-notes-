Java is a high level programming language which says write once read everywhere (WORA) 

Process flow of execution : 
1) we write the code in plain text file ending with .java extension.
2) we run the java compiler and it checks error and converts it into .class file.
3) The .class file doesn’t contain normal machine code; instead, it contains bytecode (a special set of instructions understood by the Java Virtual Machine).
4) when we use the java launcher/command it starts the jvm . the JVM reads the bytecode and translates into the instructions that your computer processor can actually execute.


JVM : It is an abstract computing machine that is responsible for executing Java program. when we write a program then source code is compile code into bytecode which is understandable by jvm and jvm converts that into the instructions that your computer understands.
-> It is responsible for the very well-known feature of Java: cross-platform. That means you can write a Java program once and run it anywhere
-> JVM is platform-dependent (different implementations for Windows, Linux, etc.), but bytecode itself is platform-independent. 


JRE : java runtime environment . its a package that provides everything needed to run Java programs.
-> it contains jvm and core libraries like collections and i/o.
-> it cant compile code . it only euns already compiled .class files. When you deploy your Java applications on client’s computer, the client needs a JRE to be installed. 

JDK : java development kit. its superset of jre . its a full toolkit for developing java apps.
-> it contains jre as well as Development tools like javac (compiler), javadoc, jar, debugger, etc.


PRIMITIVE DATATYPES : this types are predefined by the language and named by a keyword. there are 8 of this ex: int , char, float, long, boolean, byte, short, double.
-> there default value is 0.

REFERENCE DATATYPES : Reference variables are created using defined constructors of the classes. They are used to access objects. These variables are declared to be of a specific type that cannot be changed. class , objects and various arrays variable are its ex.
-> its default value is null.



VARIALBLE TYPES : variable provide us with name storage that our program can manipulate . int a; means a can only store certain values that falls within certain range that int can hold.

a) local variable : its declared inside methods ,blocks . this are created when method is entered and will be destroyed when exited.
-> access modifiers can tbe used with local variables and this are implemented at stack internally. no default value so it should be initializes with some value
