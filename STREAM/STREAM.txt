JAVA STREAMS : 

-> A stream is used to process collections of data (like arrays, lists) efficiently using functional programming.
 its like a pipeline through which data flows and gets processed step-by-step
-> earlier for collection processing we used to write foreach loop , temp list , manual counters. this approach is good but its often repetitive , error prone , harder to read .

Stream provides a better style . supports aggregate operations  and can be processed sequentially as well as parallel .
-> its a ds but doesn't store data and is not a collection. collections store the data and it processes them.
-> dont modify the original data and returns new result. Stream operations execute only when required.

# Stream pipeline : 1) Source (collection / arr/ str) , 2) 0 or more Intermediate operations 3) 1 terminal operation

# intermediate operations/methods : 1) every methods returns a new stream 2) dont execute immediately 3) ex: filter , map , sorted , limit , skip .

# terminal operations : 1) it triggers execution 2) every stream must have 1 terminal operation 3) may produce final result 4) ends the stream.

1) filter in streams: it takes a predicate function and do some condn check and remove ele that doesn't match the condn. no lazy execution.
ex: names
	.stream()
	.filter(x -> x%2==0)
	.forEach(print() )


Predicate : functional interface that represents a single-argument function returning a boolean value. - It has one abstract method: test(T t). returns true if yes else false. java internally converts the lambda into predicate . Predicate<Integer> even = x -> x%2==0;


2) Map : is used to transform each element of a stream into another form. It does 1-to-1 transformation: i.e 1 i/p ele -> 1 o/p ele. doesn't remove ele , add extra ele or change stream size.
map accepts function<T,R>. so i/p type is T and o/p type is R and it converts T to R. returns stream<R>.
ex: using object employees.stream()
         		  .map(e -> e.salary + 5000)                                   
        		  .forEach(System.out::println);

->   list.Stream()
    .map(x -> "Number: " + x)
    .forEach(System.out::println);
-> we can chain multiple maps inside 1 another 

a) mapToInt: Converts stream elements into primitive int stream. usually normal map returns Stream<Integer> , but this returns IntStream (primitive int).
-> the main reason is primitive streams like intstream , doublestream supports numeric operations like sum , min , max and avg.
-> its imp because it Avoids boxing/unboxing overhead → faster.
-> it gives direct max , min , sum ,avg functions.

b) mapToDouble : Same as mapToInt but returns double stream.

c) flatmap: where each ele of map contains a collection. it takes a function t and returns a mapper stream. it merges all stream at once.
ex: 	  customers.stream()
         .flatMap(c -> c.getOrders().stream())
         .forEach(System.out::println);


3) COLLECT : is an imp terminal operation. as streams dont store data so after processing we need somewhere to store our result so we store it inside the stream. it takes a collector and that collector decides how result will be stored. we can use functions like tolist , tomap , toset .
ex: lst.stream() 
	.filter(x -> x)
	.collect(Collector.tolist()) .

-> we can use groupingby ,  counting , joining , tocollection for custom collection.
-> so internal working is create containers , add ele and return final result. returns collection or final obje.


4) SORTED (COMPARATOR) : used to sort based on custom rule.



- A functional interface is an interface with exactly one abstract method.
- A lambda expression is a concise way to provide the implementation of that single abstract method.
-  lambdas are used to implement functional interfaces.
