###### -> so its a framework where dynamically allocated ds are supported in a unified architecture . {hashmaps  hashset , arraylist , linkedlist }.

###### -> its simply a collection of objects , where each item in a collection is called an element . 

###### -> a framework is a set of interfaces that forces you to hold up some designing practices to improve productivity and maintenance.

###### -> Java Collections Framework is a set of reusable data structures and algorithms which are designed to free programmers from implementing data structures themselves so that they can focus on business logics. 

###### 

###### there are some hierarchy associated with collections that everyone should follow . 

###### 

1. ###### top of the chain is : Iterable<E> Interface =>is an interface which takes a generic type E and read as Iterable of element of type E, declares one abstract method called iterator() to retrieve the Iterator<E> object associated with all the collections.
